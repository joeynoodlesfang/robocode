- Finish first draft of NN1 v1.0.1
	1. Import NN framework from NN2.
	2. Import + rewrite NN2 read/write structure to include hexNumInInt-config line, and settings for reset for winLose.
	3. Design NN-based SAs
	4. Misc corrections(LEL soo bad)

- Consider adding DoAction2 and if condition for modular learning.
- Consider using local variables(? is this possible)
- Adding arrays to modularize nn, use defines for numHiddens
- Consider adding in a line at bottom of file so dimensions are correct.
