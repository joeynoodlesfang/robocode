This is a robocode project that is using reinforcement learning (Q LUT) and neural net.

@insert some copyright thing saying you can use our stuff we don't care it's pretty useless stuff here@

To access the robots that we are working on, or older robots, follow the directories given below. The MyRobots directory also contains a README that explains the robots in a little more detail.

Reinforcement learning (LUT) robot:
-----------------------------------
Directory: robots -> MyRobots -> LUTTrackfire.java

Neural Net:
-----------
NN2_LUTMimic is an introductory robot designed to mimic the LUT robot behaviour, with similar states and actions as parameters.
